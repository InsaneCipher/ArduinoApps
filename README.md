# ArduinoApps
A bunch of small Arduino projects â€“ messing around with LEDs, sensors, buttons, displays, buzzers, and other basic components. Stuff like blinking patterns, reading analog/digital inputs, serial prints, LCD messages, motor control tests, and random experiments. Mostly just quick sketches I made while testing ideas or trying out parts.
